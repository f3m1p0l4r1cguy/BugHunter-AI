# üöÄ CYBERPUNK AI PENTEST AGENT 2077 üöÄ

## Overview
An advanced, resource-aware penetration testing automation tool with a stunning cyberpunk-themed GUI. This tool intelligently manages multiple security scanning tools while monitoring system resources to prevent overload.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Resource-Aware Tool Execution**
- **Smart Queue Management**: Tools are queued and executed based on available system resources
- **Concurrent Execution Control**: Configure 1-3 tools to run simultaneously
- **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: Live CPU and RAM usage tracking
- **Automatic Throttling**: System automatically pauses new tool launches when resources are constrained

### 2. **Tool Resource Profiles**
Each tool has a defined resource profile:
- **CPU Usage**: Estimated CPU percentage
- **RAM Usage**: Expected memory consumption
- **Duration**: Estimated execution time
- **Priority**: Execution priority (1=highest, 3=lowest)

Example profiles:
- `nmap`: 30% CPU, 100MB RAM, ~120s duration
- `masscan`: 80% CPU, 150MB RAM, ~300s duration
- `sqlmap`: 30% CPU, 120MB RAM, ~300s duration

### 3. **Advanced Queue System**
- **Status Tracking**: Each tool has states:
  - ‚è≥ PENDING - Waiting to be queued
  - üìã QUEUED - In queue, waiting for resources
  - ‚ö° RUNNING - Currently executing
  - ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Successfully finished
  - ‚ùå FAILED - Execution failed

- **Live Queue Display**: See what's running, queued, and completed in real-time
- **Automatic Progression**: When a tool finishes, the next one starts automatically

### 4. **Configurable Thresholds**
Adjust system resource limits:
- **CPU Threshold**: 50-90% (default: 70%)
- **RAM Threshold**: 50-90% (default: 75%)
- **Max Concurrent Tools**: 1-3 tools (default: 2)

### 5. **Cyberpunk UI Features**
- **Real-time Resource Meters**: Visual CPU and RAM usage bars
- **Animated Title**: Color-changing neon effects
- **Color-coded Console**: Different colors for different message types
- **Tool Status Panel**: Live queue and execution status
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes with neon accents

## üì¶ Requirements

### Python Packages
```bash
pip install psutil requests tkinter
```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- psutil library for resource monitoring
- tkinter for GUI (usually included with Python)
- Security tools (nmap, sqlmap, etc.) installed on your system

## üéÆ Usage

### 1. Launch the Application
```bash
python3 AIlinuxV2.py
```

### 2. Configure Settings
- **Set Max Concurrent Tools**: Choose 1, 2, or 3 simultaneous tools
- **Adjust CPU Threshold**: Use the slider (50-90%)
- **Adjust RAM Threshold**: Use the slider (50-90%)

### 3. Select Target
- Enter target IP address or domain in the "Target IP/Domain" field

### 4. Choose Tools
- Select which tools to use from the categories:
  - üîç RECONNAISSANCE (nmap, masscan, amass, etc.)
  - üìã ENUMERATION (enum4linux, smbclient, etc.)
  - üîê VULNERABILITY (nikto, sqlmap, nuclei, etc.)
  - üí£ EXPLOITATION (hydra, metasploit, etc.)

### 5. Start Scan
- Click **"‚ñ∂ INITIATE SCAN"**
- Watch the real-time progress in the console
- Monitor resource usage in the system panel
- View queue status in the tool execution panel

### 6. Monitor Progress
The interface displays:
- **System Resources**: Real-time CPU and RAM usage
- **Tool Queue**: What's running, queued, and completed
- **Console Output**: Detailed logs with timestamps
- **Scan Metrics**: Round number, active tools, CVEs found, status

### 7. Export Results
- Click **"üíæ EXPORT LOGS"** to save the final report
- Reports are saved as JSON with complete scan data

## üîß How It Works

### Resource-Aware Execution Flow

```
1. User starts scan
2. All selected tools are added to queue
3. Queue Manager checks system resources
4. If resources available AND under max concurrent:
   - Launch next tool from queue
   - Update tool status to RUNNING
5. When tool completes:
   - Mark as COMPLETED
   - Check queue for next tool
   - Repeat from step 3
6. Continue until all tools complete
```

### Resource Decision Logic

```python
# Before starting a tool, system checks:
current_cpu + tool_cpu_requirement < cpu_threshold
current_ram_available > tool_ram_requirement
running_tools_count < max_concurrent

# If all conditions met: START TOOL
# If any condition fails: WAIT and check again in 3 seconds
```

## üìä Resource Monitoring

### Real-Time Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: Updated every 2 seconds
- **RAM Usage**: Updated every 2 seconds
- **Queue Status**: Updated every 3 seconds during execution

### Color Indicators
- üü¢ **GREEN**: Usage below 80% of threshold (safe)
- üü° **YELLOW**: Usage between 80-100% of threshold (caution)
- üî¥ **RED**: Usage above threshold (critical)

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. **Start Conservative**
- Begin with 1-2 concurrent tools
- Monitor system performance
- Increase if system handles it well

### 2. **Adjust Thresholds Based on Hardware**
- **Low-end systems**: 60% CPU, 65% RAM, 1-2 concurrent
- **Mid-range systems**: 70% CPU, 75% RAM, 2 concurrent
- **High-end systems**: 80% CPU, 85% RAM, 2-3 concurrent

### 3. **Tool Selection**
- Start with lightweight tools (whatweb, wafw00f)
- Progress to medium tools (nmap, nikto)
- Finally use heavy tools (masscan, hydra)

### 4. **Resource-Heavy Tools**
Tools that consume significant resources:
- `masscan` (80% CPU)
- `hydra` (50% CPU)
- `metasploit` (40% CPU, 300MB RAM)

Consider running these alone or with one lightweight tool.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Legal Notice
- **ONLY** use this tool on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Unauthorized penetration testing is illegal
- This tool is for educational and authorized security testing only

### Safety Features
- **Command Validation**: Dangerous commands are filtered
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents system overload
- **Error Logging**: All errors are logged for review
- **Graceful Termination**: Can stop scan at any time

## üé® Customization

### Changing Resource Thresholds
Edit the default values in code:
```python
self.resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor(
    cpu_threshold=70,  # Change CPU threshold
    ram_threshold=75   # Change RAM threshold
)
```

### Adding New Tools
Add tool profiles to `TOOL_RESOURCES`:
```python
"newtool": {
    "cpu": 25,        # CPU percentage
    "ram": 100,       # RAM in MB
    "duration": 120,  # Estimated seconds
    "priority": 2     # 1=high, 2=medium, 3=low
}
```

### Modifying Colors
Edit the cyberpunk color scheme:
```python
self.colors = {
    'neon_cyan': '#00ffff',    # Change colors
    'neon_pink': '#ff00ff',
    'neon_green': '#00ff00',
    # ... etc
}
```

## üìà Performance Tips

### Optimal Configuration
- **CPU-bound tools** (nmap, masscan): Run 1-2 at a time
- **Network-bound tools** (whatweb, wafw00f): Can run 2-3 at a time
- **Mixed workload**: Use default settings (2 concurrent, 70% CPU, 75% RAM)

### Monitoring
Watch the resource meters:
- If CPU consistently red: Lower CPU threshold or reduce concurrent tools
- If RAM consistently red: Lower RAM threshold or reduce concurrent tools
- If queue moves slowly: System is resource-constrained, adjust settings

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Tools not starting
**Solution**: Check resource thresholds - system may be at capacity

### Problem: High CPU/RAM usage
**Solution**: Reduce max concurrent tools or increase thresholds

### Problem: Tools marked as FAILED
**Solution**: Check error log in scan directory, tool may not be installed

### Problem: Queue not progressing
**Solution**: Check if tools are actually executing, verify tool installation
