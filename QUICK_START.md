## Understanding the Interface

### Resource Meters
- **Green**: Healthy (< 80% of threshold)
- **Yellow**: Caution (80-100% of threshold)
- **Red**: At capacity (> threshold)

### Tool Status Icons
- ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Not yet queued
- üìã **QUEUED**: Waiting for resources
- ‚ö° **RUNNING**: Currently executing
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Successfully finished
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Execution failed

### Console Colors
- üîµ **Cyan**: System information
- üíö **Green**: Success messages
- üíõ **Yellow**: Running/warning
- üíó **Pink**: Round/phase info
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red**: Errors/critical findings

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fast System, Many Tools
```
Settings:
‚úì Max Concurrent: 3
‚úì CPU Threshold: 80%
‚úì RAM Threshold: 85%

Result: Faster scans, tools complete quickly
```

### Scenario 2: Slow System, Few Tools
```
Settings:
‚úì Max Concurrent: 1
‚úì CPU Threshold: 60%
‚úì RAM Threshold: 65%

Result: Slower but stable, system remains responsive
```

### Scenario 3: Balanced (Recommended)
```
Settings:
‚úì Max Concurrent: 2
‚úì CPU Threshold: 70%
‚úì RAM Threshold: 75%

Result: Good balance of speed and stability
```

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Start with default settings
- Monitor resource meters
- Wait for each round to complete
- Review the console output
- Export logs when done

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Set thresholds too high (>85%)
- Run 3+ tools on low-end systems
- Close terminal windows that open
- Interrupt scans unnecessarily
- Scan unauthorized targets

## Stopping a Scan

1. Click **"‚èπ TERMINATE"** button
2. Wait for current tools to finish (few seconds)
3. Check console for confirmation:
   ```
   [14:30:15] ‚ö† SCAN TERMINATED BY USER
   ```

## Exporting Results

1. Click **"üíæ EXPORT LOGS"** button
2. Choose save location
3. Give it a name (e.g., `scan_example_com.json`)
4. Click **Save**

The exported file contains:
- All scan rounds
- Tools used
- CVEs discovered
- Timestamps
- Tool execution statistics

## Interpreting Results

### In the Console
Look for:
- `üö® CVEs DISCOVERED`: Security vulnerabilities found
- `‚úÖ COMPLETED`: Tools that finished successfully
- `‚ùå FAILED`: Tools that encountered errors
- `ü§ñ AI RESPONSE`: AI analysis and recommendations

### In the Export File
Open with any text editor to see:
```json
{
  "session_id": "20241013_142345_a1b2",
  "target": "example.com",
  "rounds": [
    {
      "round": 1,
      "tools": ["nmap", "nikto", "sqlmap"],
      "cves": ["CVE-2021-1234"],
      "completed": 3,
      "failed": 0
    }
  ],
  "completed_at": "2024-10-13T14:45:23"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Nothing happens when I click Start
**Solution**: Make sure you entered a target

### Problem: Tools immediately show as FAILED
**Solution**: Tools may not be installed on your system

### Problem: CPU/RAM always red
**Solution**: Lower the thresholds or reduce max concurrent tools

### Problem: Queue not progressing
**Solution**: System at capacity, wait or adjust settings

### Problem: Application won't start
**Solution**: Run `install_dependencies.py` first

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full README**: `CYBERPUNK_PENTEST_README.md`
2. **Understand optimizations**: `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`
3. **Configure API keys**: Edit the `API_KEYS` list in the code
4. **Install security tools**: nmap, nikto, sqlmap, etc.
5. **Practice on test systems**: Use your own VMs or lab environments

## Legal Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Only scan systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.

This tool is for:
- ‚úÖ Your own systems
- ‚úÖ Systems you have permission to test

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Review the `errors.log` file in the scan directory
3. Verify all security tools are installed
4. Check system requirements
5. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
